"""
Channel metadata -> one code per channel, for the legacy BERTWaveletTransformer.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Four modes, each a single change on the one before, so every row of the ablation
differs from its neighbour in one thing:

``none``    no code at all; the model is bit-for-bit the one without this file.
``id``      a learned embedding of the channel's name, looked up by integer id.
            This is the EEGPT-style channel token (their Eq. 11) and is the
            baseline the physical encoding has to beat.
``signed``  the derivation's geometry. A bipolar channel A-B is not a point: it
            is an ordered pair, and the sign of A-B against B-A is the entire
            difference between the two. Encoding only a midpoint throws that
            away, so midpoint and direction are carried separately.
``hybrid``  ``Norm(id + signed)`` -- whether a learned name and a physical
            derivation say different things.

What this deliberately is NOT:

* It is not reference-invariant, and nothing here should be described that way.
  A learned map of a signed derivation is not invariant to re-referencing; it
  merely stops being blind to it.
* It does not encode a montage topology. There are no neighbour graphs, no
  Laplacians and no CSD: on two channels those degenerate, and a topology term
  that cannot be evaluated is a claim rather than a component.
* It is not applied to the waveform. Adding a per-channel vector to raw EEG
  would put a DC offset on the signal that every downstream filter then has to
  model. The code conditions the fold's scale choice and the patch tokens.

The forward path takes numeric tensors only. Names are resolved to integer ids
once, in preprocessing, and travel in the HDF5; nothing here parses a string.
