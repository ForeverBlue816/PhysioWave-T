# data.nemar.org over HTTPS, resumably; nemar-cli is a node package that adds
# nothing, and a login node without npm is the normal case.

# TDBRAIN IS NOT DOWNLOADED HERE and cannot be. It needs an ORCID login and an
# accepted data use agreement, and accepting an agreement is not something a
# script does on your behalf. `tdbrain` prints what to do instead.

# HBN is on open S3, but the "Not for Commercial Use" releases are excluded
# from the main model -- R1-R11 are the standard ones and are what `all` fetches.

TDBRAIN is not downloaded by this script.

It requires an ORCID login and an accepted Data Use Agreement, and the DUA also
forbids redistribution -- so the transfer has to be yours, made under your own
acceptance of it.

  1. https://brainclinics.com/resources/tdbrain-dataset
  2. Register with an INSTITUTIONAL address. Their spam protection may drop
     mail to gmail and the like, and the download password comes by email.
  3. Take "TDBRAIN Dataset V3.1". ~15 GB zipped, ~20 GB unpacked.
  4. Put the zip under $EEG_ROOT/TDBRAIN/raw.

The zip is PASSWORD PROTECTED. The password is in the DUA email. Unpack with:

    TDBRAIN_PW='<from the email>' \
    python scripts/unpack_archive.py TDBRAIN_V3.1.zip \
        --extract-to . --password-env TDBRAIN_PW

--password-env rather than --password so it stays out of shell history and out
of `ps`. If it reports AES encryption, Python's zipfile cannot read that: use
`7z x` or `pip install pyzipper` and rerun.

Then, as with every other corpus:

  DATASET=tdbrain INSPECT=40 VERIFY_POWERLINE=1 bash EEG/preprocess_eeg_corpus.sh

Read the coverage line before launching anything. TDBRAIN records 26 electrodes
against E32_512's 32 slots, so expect 26 of 32 (81%) and an empty-slot rate of
18.8% -- both inside the gates. The six unrecorded slots stay zero with
valid_channel_mask False. Nothing interpolates them: a spatially interpolated
channel is a smooth function of its neighbours, and the model would learn the
interpolation.

Two things to check in that report, both new in V3:
  * The format is BDF/BDF+. The BrainVision and .csv releases are withdrawn.
  * Every file carries a BioSemi "Status" channel as its LAST channel, all
    zeros in the resting recordings. It should appear under DROPPED and NOT in
    the filled slots. It is dropped because slots are matched by NAME; a
    positional rule would have put an all-zero channel in an electrode's slot.
