"""What a pretraining run has actually done so far, per route and per dataset.

    python scripts/eeg_c1_progress.py $PW_CKPT_ROOT/pretrain_eeg_c1_moe_n1

THE LOSS IS NOT THE SUMMARY. `val total` is an average over validation BATCHES,
and the validation sweep is proportional to corpus size while the training
mixture is not: 96.8% of validation batches are TUEG or HBN, against 37% of
training steps. A model specialising toward the five small corpora -- which
balanced sampling shows it 20 to 50 times each -- therefore looks like a model
getting worse, and the per-route columns and `macro_total` are what tell the
two apart.

THE TWO RECONSTRUCTION LOSSES ARE NOT COMPARABLE TO EACH OTHER. `val_spec` is
an MSE on per-patch normalised wavelet coefficients; `val_raw` is a SmoothL1 on
z-scored volts with a knee at beta=0.5. The raw column is the smaller number
for reasons of units, not of quality. The columns that compare the two heads
are `spec_corr` against `raw_corr` (dimensionless) and `spec_nmse` against
`raw_nmse` (1.0 is what predicting zero scores on that head's own target).
