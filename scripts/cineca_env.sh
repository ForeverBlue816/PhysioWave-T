#   venv         $HOME/pw                     built on top of the cineca-ai module
#   checkpoints  $FAST/yanlchen/runs          permanent, project-shared, low latency

#
# WARNING: $SCRATCH is *temporary* -- files are purged 40 days after creation.
# The corpora under $SCRATCH/bio are reproducible from the raw archives, but
# nothing else may live there.  Anything you cannot rebuild belongs in $FAST.
#
# Every path below is an environment variable with a default, so a single
# `sbatch --export=ALL,PW_CKPT_ROOT=...` overrides it without editing this file.
#
# Two jobs in one file, and you often want only the first
# ------------------------------------------------------
#   1. export the PW_* paths
#   2. load the cineca-ai module and activate ${PW_VENV}, for training
#
# The data preparation scripts need (1) and nothing from (2) -- no CUDA, no
# torch -- and (2) actively gets in their way, because activating ${PW_VENV}
# replaces whatever environment they were being run from. So:
#
#     PW_VARS_ONLY=1 source scripts/cineca_env.sh
#
# exports the paths and touches neither the modules nor the virtualenv, and can
# be sourced before or after `source $HOME/pwprep/bin/activate` without
# disturbing it. PW_SKIP_MODULES=1 is the narrower version: skip the module
# load, still activate ${PW_VENV}.
# =============================================================================

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# 0. Where are we?
#
# Off-cluster the module/venv steps are skipped and every path falls back to a
# repository-relative default, so the same launch scripts work on a laptop
# without a second code path.
#
# THE ANSWER MUST NOT DEPEND ON ONE VARIABLE. This used to read $FAST alone. A
# batch job submitted from a shell where $FAST was not set therefore decided it
# was a laptop, skipped the module load and the venv, and ran on whatever
# `python` the submitting shell had on PATH -- which under `--export=ALL` is
# inherited. Four earlier jobs "worked" only because the submitting shell
# happened to have $HOME/pw active; the first one submitted from a shell
# without it got cineca-ai's own interpreter, which has torch and no pywt, and
# died on all sixteen ranks. The modulefile tree is a fact about the machine
# rather than about the shell, so it is the one that decides.

#   * `export PYTHONPATH=""` -- cineca-ai injects its site-packages through
#     PYTHONPATH.  Clearing it makes `import torch` fail on the compute node.
#   * `module load cuda/... gcc/...` on top -- cineca-ai already pins a matching
#     toolchain; loading another CUDA silently mixes runtimes.
