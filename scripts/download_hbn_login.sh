# !! THIS SCRIPT MOVES ~1.9 TB THROUGH A LOGIN NODE. ON MOST HPC SYSTEMS,     !!
# !! INCLUDING CINECA'S, THAT VIOLATES THE ACCEPTED USE POLICY AND CAN GET    !!
# !! YOUR ACCOUNT SUSPENDED. Check your site's policy and ask your support    !!
# !! desk for the sanctioned transfer route FIRST.                            !!
#
# An earlier version of this script treated a SIGKILL from the login node as an
# obstacle and looped to restart the transfer after each one. That was wrong. A
# login node killing a process is the SITE ENFORCING A LIMIT, not a transient
# failure, and automatically retrying past it is circumventing a control that
# exists so one user cannot degrade the node for everyone else. It now STOPS on
# a kill and says so.
#
# The situation this was written for -- compute nodes with no route to the
# internet, so no batch job can download -- is real, and the answer to it is to
# ask the support desk which host is meant for data transfer. Most sites have
# one. It is not to find a way around the login node's limits.
#
# WHAT TO DO INSTEAD, in order:
#   1. Ask support for the data-transfer host or service for your project.
#   2. If a login node is genuinely the sanctioned route, ask what size and
#      duration are acceptable and stay inside it -- MAX_GB_PER_RUN below.
#   3. Transfer to a machine that is allowed to, then move it in.
#
#   bash scripts/download_hbn_login.sh R10 R11
#
# ENVIRONMENT:
#   EEG_ROOT         corpus root
#   AWS_CONCURRENCY  transfers in flight (default 3)
#   MAX_GB_PER_RUN   stop after roughly this much in one invocation (default
#                    50). A ceiling you can point at in a support request,
#                    rather than an open-ended transfer.
#   I_HAVE_CHECKED_THE_POLICY=1   required to run at all.

REFUSING TO RUN.

This moves hundreds of gigabytes through a login node. On most HPC systems,
CINECA's included, that breaches the accepted use policy, and repeated
offences can get an account suspended -- which has already happened once
while using an earlier version of this script.

Ask your support desk which host is meant for data transfer. If the answer
is that a login node is acceptable for this, run again with:

    I_HAVE_CHECKED_THE_POLICY=1 MAX_GB_PER_RUN=50 bash "$0" R10 R11
