# It asks before publishing, and refuses outright when stdin is not a terminal
# unless CONFIRM=1 is set. Every check before that point is safe to run.
#
# `pip install -U huggingface_hub` into the TRAINING venv is what this exists to
# avoid, and it fails twice over.
#
#   * $HOME/pw is built --system-site-packages on top of the cineca-ai module,
#     which ships transformers and tokenizers pinned to huggingface_hub<1.0.
#     Upgrading it to 1.x satisfies nothing and breaks those two, and pip says
#     so in a warning that scrolls past under a "Successfully installed" line.
#   * the module also puts its own site-packages on PYTHONPATH, which sys.path
#     honours BEFORE the venv. So `hf` -- the 1.x console script -- starts, and
#     `import huggingface_hub` lands on the module's 0.x copy, which has no
#     .cli submodule. ModuleNotFoundError, from a package that installed fine.
#
# A venv with no system site-packages and an empty PYTHONPATH has neither
# problem, and uploading needs nothing from the training environment: no torch,
# no cineca-ai, just requests over HTTPS.
#
# The training venv is left alone. If it was already upgraded, this prints how
# to put it back.
