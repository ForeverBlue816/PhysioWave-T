                  and the honest baseline for everything above it.
    ``learned``   ``sum_s w[s,c] b[s,c,t]``, unconstrained. Free to grow, go
                  negative, or shrink the signal as a whole, and it carries one
                  parameter per (scale, channel) so it cannot transfer to a
                  different channel count.
    ``softmax``   the same weights through a softmax over scales. Convex, so
                  the fold is an interpolation of the bands and the output
                  magnitude stays in the bands' range.
    ``dynamic``   weights predicted per (channel, time-block) from the bands'
                  own statistics, by an MLP shared across channels. This is
                  best-basis selection (Coifman & Wickerhauser 1992) made
                  differentiable: the cost function is learned instead of being
                  Shannon entropy, and the choice is soft instead of a tree
                  search. Being shared across channels, it is also the only
                  mode with no channel-shaped parameter.

    Two options attach to ``dynamic``:

    ``synthesis_kernel``  a short depthwise filter per scale, delta-initialised
        and shared across channels -- the learnable ``g_s`` above. The bands
        have already been through soft gating and *nearest* upsampling, so they
        are not phase-aligned with each other; a scalar weight cannot fix that
        and a 3- or 5-tap filter can.
    ``shrinkage``  soft-thresholding per scale before the fold, with the
        threshold learned and the noise level estimated by MAD (Donoho 1995).
        The threshold starts at ~0.0025 sigma, i.e. off, because in sEMG the
        high-frequency detail is partly signal and hard shrinkage would remove
        it; letting the data decide is the point.

    Everything is initialised so that the module *is* ``mean`` at step 0:
    delta filters, zero thresholds, zero-initialised output layer and zero
    scale logits (so alpha is uniform), and ``gamma`` gating the deviation from
    the mean. Training therefore departs from the reconstruction rather than
    starting somewhere arbitrary.
