Fine-tuning a C1 pretrained encoder on a task with its own montage.

WHAT TRANSFERS IS DECIDED BY THE ARCHITECTURE, NOT CHOSEN
---------------------------------------------------------

The pretrainer's parts are bound to different things, and that binding is what
says which of them a downstream task can reuse:

    wavelet frontend    per ELECTRODE COUNT -- the filters are per-channel, so
                        a frontend built for 64 electrodes is not a frontend
                        for 2. NOT transferable.
    patch embedding     per PATCH LENGTH -- 128 samples at 256 Hz, 50 at 100.
                        NOT transferable across sampling rates.
    channel encoder     per CHANNEL NAME, against a vocabulary shared by every
                        corpus. Transferable, and the point of C1.
    channel projection  }
    channel gate        } the same, and the gate is what scales the whole
                        contribution -- an encoder loaded without it has the
                        C1 mechanism switched off.
    position encoding   generated per call from (channels, patches). No
                        parameters, so nothing to transfer.
    transformer         bound to nothing. THE thing pretraining produced.

So a task whose montage and rate match a pretraining route (P300 is 62
channels at 256 Hz, all of them E64_256 slots, at that route's rate) reuses
everything,
and a task that does not (Sleep-EDF is two bipolar derivations at 100 Hz)
builds a fresh frontend and patcher and reuses the rest. Both are the same
class; the difference is which keys the checkpoint supplies.

THE COMPARISON THAT MEANS SOMETHING is this model with pretrained weights
against this model without them -- same architecture, same recipe, same split.
``pretrained=None`` is that control and is one flag away, because a downstream
number with nothing to compare it to says only that the architecture works.
