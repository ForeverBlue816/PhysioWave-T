"""
One place that says what the EEG C1 objective is.

The trainer computed its weights from ``objective:``, the visualizer read
``train.spec_recon_weight`` -- a key the config had stopped writing -- and fell
back to a literal 1.0/0.25; the progress script quoted neither. Those numbers
agreed only for as long as nobody changed them. Moving the config to 0.5/0.5
would have left the figures captioned 0.25 with nothing in the pipeline able to
notice: both numbers were defaults, both were plausible, and only one was the
one the optimizer followed.

So the resolution lives here and every consumer calls it -- the trainer, the
startup banner, the figures, the progress report. A default that is wrong is
then wrong in one place and shows up everywhere at once, which is the only
version of that bug anybody finds.

    L_total = spec_weight * L_spec
            + raw_weight  * L_raw
            + fold_kl     * L_foldKL

    L_spec  masked MSE      ( pred_spec, stopgrad(normalised folded wavelet) )
    L_raw   masked SmoothL1 ( pred_raw,  stopgrad(preprocessed EEG), beta )

The canonical configuration is 0.5 / 0.5: two reconstruction terms of equal
standing, not one objective and one hint. See configs/pretrain/eeg_c1_moe.yaml.
