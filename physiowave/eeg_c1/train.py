"""
Training loop for the EEG C1 multi-route pretrainer.

The objective:

    loss = spec_weight * masked MSE on the DETACHED clean folded-wavelet
           patches, normalised per patch
         + raw_weight  * masked SmoothL1 on the DETACHED preprocessed EEG
           patches
         + fold_kl     * ScaleFold KL

    at spec_weight = raw_weight = 0.5, resolved from the config by
    ``physiowave.eeg_c1.objective.resolve_eeg_c1_objective`` -- the one place
    those numbers are read, so the banner, the figures and the progress report
    cannot each quote a different default.

    Under mask_before_frontend the masked patches are zeroed in the SIGNAL
    before the wavelet frontend runs, so nothing inside a masked patch can
    reach a visible token through the frontend.

and nothing else. No reference consistency, no contrastive term, no query
specialisation -- those belong to the WAST/TARE path, which this one does not
touch.

Four things here are less obvious than the loop:

**The two losses are not comparable in magnitude.** An MSE on normalised
wavelet coefficients and a SmoothL1 on z-scored volts are different units with
a different penalty shape; the raw term is the smaller number for reasons that
have nothing to do with which head is doing better. The comparison is
``masked_{spec,raw}_corr`` and ``masked_{spec,raw}_nmse``, both dimensionless,
both reported globally and per route and per dataset.

**Validation metrics are aggregated across ranks, breakdowns included.** The
sweep is partitioned, so a per-route mean computed on one rank is a mean over
that rank's slice. Sums and counts are all-reduced and the mean taken from the
totals.

**Validation masks are fixed.** A validation loss computed under a fresh random
mask each epoch moves because the mask moved, and the curve then measures the
sampler. Each validation batch draws its mask from a generator seeded by
(mask seed, dataset, first window index), so epoch 12 masks exactly what epoch 1
masked and a change in the curve is a change in the model.

**Resume restores the sampling sequence, not just the weights.** The schedule is
a pure function of (seed, epoch), and the step within the epoch is checkpointed,
so a resumed run draws the batches the interrupted one would have drawn next.
Restoring the model and letting the sampler start over would quietly re-train on
the first half of the epoch and skip the second.

        Initialising STARTS a run from another's representation -- and the
        difference matters most exactly when you want it, because a new mixture
        changes steps_per_epoch, and a scheduler resumed across that change is

        into a 954-step one leaves the cosine 20% short of annealed at the end
        of the run, at a learning rate an order of magnitude above where it
