"""
The four hard routes of the EEG C1 pretraining corpus.

A route is the (electrode count, sampling rate) shape a batch arrives in. It is
fixed by the table below and chosen by ``route_id`` carried in the data -- there
is no learned router here, and this is deliberately not a mixture of experts:
which frontend runs is a property of the recording, known before the model sees
it, so making it a learned decision would be inventing a choice that does not
exist.

Every route window is 4 seconds and every patch is 0.5 seconds, so every route has
exactly 8 time patches per channel and the token count is just the electrode
count times eight. That is what keeps one Transformer usable across all four:
the sequence length changes, the meaning of a position does not.

#: montage, in the order the widest one lists them. That is what excludes the
#: five aux channels the 133-channel files carry (EOGh, EOGv, EMG_RH, EMG_LH,
#: EMG_RF) without a hand-maintained blocklist, and it is why this is exactly
#: 128 rather than a list padded to fit.
#:
#: It is 10-05, not 10-10: fifty of these are halfway positions (FFC5h lies
#: between FFC5 and FFC3). An earlier version of this list was assembled from
#: 10-10 names and a guess, and it resolved only 74 of the 128 -- below the
#: coverage gate, so every HGD recording would have been skipped.
#:
#: Kept separate from SLOTS_128 because HGD occupies the E128_512 route by
#: shape, not by sharing HBN's electrode identities: HBN records EGI net
#: positions (E1..E128) and these are scalp labels. A shard from one leaves the
#: other's slots padded, which is the honest outcome for two montages that
#: genuinely do not align.
#:
#: Cz is at index 15 and is the RECORDING REFERENCE -- the authors note residual
#: signal remains on it, so it is a real but attenuated channel, not a dead one.
