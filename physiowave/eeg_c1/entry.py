Entry point for the EEG C1 route, dispatched from physiowave.train.pretrain_main.

Kept out of pretrain_main so that adding this path costs the WAST/TARE path one
`if`: the two share no model, no objective and no data builder, and threading
this one through the other's loop would have meant making every stage of it
conditional.
