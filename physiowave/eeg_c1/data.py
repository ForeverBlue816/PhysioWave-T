"""
Corpus index, lazy HDF5 windows, and a route-aware sampler that works under DDP.

Three problems this file exists to solve.

**Nothing may be loaded eagerly.** TUEG does not fit in memory and the top-level
pretrain.py loads every HDF5 it is given. Here a shard is opened per worker on
first touch and read window by window; the index holds counts and offsets, not
signal.

**A batch may not mix routes.** 19x1024 and 128x2048 are different shapes, and
padding one to the other would mean explaining the padding to the attention. So
a step picks one route and every sample in it comes from that route.

**Every rank must agree on the route, without talking.** If rank 0 runs E19 while
rank 1 runs E128, the all-reduce at the end of the step waits for gradients on
parameters the other rank never touched, and the job deadlocks. The route
sequence is therefore drawn from a generator seeded by (seed, epoch) alone --
identical on every rank by construction, no broadcast needed -- and only the
sample indices within the chosen route differ between ranks.

The mixture is enforced by the schedule, not by a sampler weight.
``WeightedRandomSampler`` is skipped outright under DistributedSampler (see
physiowave/train/data_builder.py), which is exactly how TUEG would have come to
be 90% of a run that was configured for 25%.
