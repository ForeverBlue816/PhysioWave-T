"""
Multi-route EEG pretrainer: four wavelet frontends, one Transformer.

The seven corpora do not share an electrode count or a sampling rate, and the
parts of the model that depend on those are exactly the parts that are
duplicated. Everything that does not is shared, because sharing it is the whole
point -- a separate model per corpus would be seven pretrainings, not one.

    per route (4)     SoftGateWaveletDecomp + dynamic ScaleFold
                      the wavelet filters are per-channel, so a frontend is
                      tied to its electrode count and cannot be shared
    per rate  (2)     PatchEmbed, reconstruction head
                      a 0.5 s patch is 128 samples at 256 Hz and 256 at 512,
                      so the conv kernel and the decoder width follow the rate
                      and nothing else -- two of each, not four
    shared    (1)     ChannelEncoder (C1, id), its projection and gate,
                      the 2-D position encoding, the mask token,
                      the RoPE Transformer encoder

The 2-D position encoding is sinusoidal and parameter-free -- it is generated
from (freq_size, time_size) at every call -- so one instance serves all four
token counts with nothing to resize and nothing to learn per route.

Routing is by ``route_id``, which the data carries. There is no learned gate
and this is not a mixture of experts: the recording's montage is known before
the model sees it.

    L_spec = masked MSE      ( pred_spec, stopgrad(clean folded wavelet) )
    L_raw  = masked SmoothL1 ( pred_raw,  stopgrad(clean preprocessed EEG) )

Three properties this shape exists to get, each of which the previous version
lacked:

**The target is stop-gradient.** It is produced by the very frontend being
trained -- learnable wavelet filters and a learnable ScaleFold -- so without
``detach`` the reconstruction term could be reduced by moving the target
instead of by predicting it. Nothing about that is a representation getting
better.

**The corruption happens to the SIGNAL, before the frontend.** The frontend
contains temporal convolution and cross-scale attention, so a patch that is
masked at the token site has already spread into its neighbours' features by
the time the mask token replaces it. Masking the raw samples first closes that
path. The mask token is kept as well: with the samples zeroed, the frontend's
response to a zero-filled stretch would otherwise identify the missing patch
just as reliably.

**There is a second target.** Reconstructing only the folded wavelet
representation lets the frontend choose what is easy to reconstruct. Predicting
the preprocessed EEG as well ties the tokens to the measured signal.
