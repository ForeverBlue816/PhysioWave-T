"""
The preprocessing every ECG corpus goes through.

Adapters (ECG/preprocess_ecg_corpus.py) differ only in how a record is READ.
Everything after that is here and identical for every corpus, so a difference
between two datasets in training is a difference between the datasets.

    to mV -> DC removal -> notch (mains, if any) -> 0.5 Hz high-pass
          -> polyphase resample to the route's rate -> leads onto slots
          -> 10 s windows -> window QC -> normalise

What is ECG-specific, and why:

* **Units are mV,** the unit every ECG convention is stated in, so the QC
  thresholds below mean the same thing on every corpus. The normalisation is
  scale-free, so the unit only matters to the QC -- which is exactly where a
  unit error would otherwise pass silently.

* **The high-pass is second-order sections with a long mirrored pad.** 0.5 Hz
  at 500 Hz is a normalised cutoff of 0.002, where a 4th-order Butterworth in
  (b, a) form is badly conditioned, and filtfilt's default pad (15 samples) is
  one thirtieth of a second against a filter that rings for seconds. On a
  10 s record the edge transient would be a fifth of the window.

  The pad is EVEN (mirrored), not odd. Odd extension reflects through the
  last sample, so a record that ends on an R wave gets a pad whose level is
  the R-wave amplitude -- a step the filter then rings on, back into the
  record. Measured against the same filter run on 70 s of context, over 40
  random 10 s crops of synthetic 12-lead ECG with baseline wander: odd padding
  left a worst-case edge error of 1.06 mV (mean relative error 12.6%), even
  padding 0.12 mV (6.0%). Linear detrending first changed neither.

* **No low-pass or band-pass.** The polyphase resampler's anti-alias filter is
  the only one. A 40 Hz low-pass is a visualisation convention; it removes the
  QRS energy that notching and fragmentation live in.

* **The normalisation keeps the leads' relative amplitudes.** The default
  (``window_shared``) removes each lead's mean and divides the whole window by
  ONE standard deviation, taken over all its leads together. Per-lead z-scoring
  -- what the EEG corpus does -- would erase the ratios between leads, and in
  ECG those ratios ARE the diagnosis: the frontal axis is the ratio of I to aVF,
  low voltage and LVH are amplitude criteria, a lead's inversion relative to
  another is the finding. ``window_per_lead`` is available for comparison, and
  ``none`` keeps mV.

* **Missing limb leads are derived, not padded.** III, aVR, aVL and aVF are
  exact combinations of I and II; a file that stores only I, II and V1-V6 (the
  eight independent leads) has all twelve.

* **A window is dropped, not repaired.** A window containing a non-finite
  sample, a flat lead (disconnected electrode) or an implausible amplitude
  (a unit error, or saturation) is left out and counted by reason. A 10 s
  record is exactly one window, so that is a dropped record; the counts say
  how many, per reason, per corpus.
