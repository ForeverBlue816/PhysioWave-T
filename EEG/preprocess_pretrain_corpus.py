"""
Preprocess one EEG corpus into the C1 pretraining HDF5 schema.

    python EEG/preprocess_pretrain_corpus.py \
        --dataset faced --root /path/to/raw --out-dir /path/to/processed/faced

One dataset per invocation, because they are acquired at different rates on
different montages and the failures are dataset-shaped. Every run writes
manifest_train.jsonl, manifest_val.jsonl, dataset_statistics.json and
preprocessing_failures.jsonl into --out-dir; a recording that cannot be read
lands in the failures file with its reason and does not stop the run.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. It does not download anything. TUEG, HBN, M3CV and
TDBRAIN are all behind data use agreements, and a script that fetches them on
the user's behalf is a script that agrees to a licence on the user's behalf.
Point --root at data you already have.

SYNTHETIC DATA. --smoke-test generates noise so the pipeline itself can be
exercised without any corpus present. It is the only path that produces
synthetic windows, it stamps ``"synthetic": true`` into every shard's
provenance, and it writes to a directory it names ``smoke_*``. Nothing falls
back to it: a missing --root is an error, not a reason to invent data.
