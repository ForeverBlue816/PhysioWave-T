# EEG C1 multi-route pretraining -- the recommended entry point.
#
#   bash EEG/pretrain_eeg_c1_moe.sh
#
# Four wavelet frontends over seven corpora, one shared RoPE Transformer, C1
# channel-name embedding injected at the token site. This is NOT the WAST/TARE
# path: it shares no module with it, and configs/pretrain/eeg.yaml is a
# different run.
#
# BEFORE THE FIRST RUN the corpora have to be preprocessed, once per dataset:
#
#   python EEG/preprocess_pretrain_corpus.py --dataset tueg \
#       --root ${PW_DATA_EEG}/tueg --out-dir ${DATA_ROOT}/tueg --mains-hz 60
#
# and their manifests merged into ${DATA_ROOT}/merged. That step needs mne and
# belongs under $HOME/pwprep, not in the training venv.
#
# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES, all optional:
#
#   NUM_GPUS              GPUs per node                              (4)
#   NNODES                nodes                            ($SLURM_NNODES or 1)
#   CONFIG                which objective          (pretrain/eeg_c1_moe = full)
#   EPOCHS                                                    (the config's)
#   MAX_STEPS             stop after this many optimizer steps      (unset)
#   BATCH_SIZE_BY_ROUTE   "E19_256=128,E32_512=96,E64_256=48,E128_512=24"
#   GRAD_ACCUMULATION                                         (the config's)
#   LR / WEIGHT_DECAY / MASK_RATIO / SEED                     (the config's)
#   WEIGHTS               balanced | proportional | temperature:0.5
#   VIS_EVERY_EPOCHS      snapshot cadence for the figures        (the config's)
#   DATA_ROOT             holds merged/manifest_{train,val}.jsonl
#   OUTPUT_DIR            checkpoints and figures
#   RESUME                'auto' to continue OUTPUT_DIR/latest.pth
#   INIT_FROM             another checkpoint's WEIGHTS, fresh schedule
#   STEPS_PER_EPOCH       override the mixture-derived epoch length
#   SET                   "model.embed_dim=512 model.depth=8" -- anything
#
# UNSET MEANS THE CONFIG DECIDES for the hyperparameters. None of them has a
# default here; a default here would be a second copy of a number that already
# has a home, and the copy would win.
#
# DATA_ROOT AND OUTPUT_DIR ARE PATHS AND ARE CHECKED. Both are usually built
# from ${PW_DATA_EEG} and ${PW_CKPT_ROOT}, which scripts/cineca_env.sh sets and
# your login profile does not. Submitting from a shell that never sourced it
# turns $PW_CKPT_ROOT/run into /run, which --export=ALL carries into the job.
#
# These are VALUES passed straight through, not `${VAR:+--flag}` presence
# tests: MASK_RATIO=0 is a non-empty string and that idiom would read it as on.
# The presence test that decides whether to override at all is `-n`, for the
# same reason.
