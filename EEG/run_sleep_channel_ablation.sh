# Sleep-EDF channel-embedding ablation
# ============================================================================
# Six variants against the current strong baseline. Only the channel metadata,
# its encoder, and where the code is injected change; everything else -- the
# waveform, the preprocessing, the split, the schedule, the backbone -- is held
# fixed, and a test pins the legacy parameters to the same values at one seed.
#
#   C0  none    none    the baseline this is measured against
#   C1  id      token   EEGPT-style learned channel-name embedding
#   C2  signed  token   the derivation's geometry instead of its name
#   C3  signed  fold    the same code, biasing only the scale choice
#   C4  signed  dual    both injection sites
#   C5  hybrid  dual    whether a name and a geometry say different things
#
# Plumbing check -- two runs, on the same four-GPU path the real ones take:
#
#   VARIANTS=C0,C4 SEEDS=42 FOLDS=0 NUM_GPUS=4 EPOCHS=2 \
#       bash EEG/run_sleep_channel_ablation.sh
#
# Not five variants times three seeds on one GPU. That is fifteen runs and a
# couple of hours, and one process does not exercise the multi-rank path.
#
# Full (six variants x ten folds x three seeds = 180 runs -- read the note on
# cost below before starting it):
#
#   VARIANTS=C0,C1,C2,C3,C4,C5 SEEDS=42,43,44 FOLDS=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 \
#       NUM_GPUS=4 bash EEG/run_sleep_channel_ablation.sh
#
# COST. Ten epochs is 10310 steps at the default batch on four GPUs. The
# twenty-epoch figure this script used to quote was an estimate, never timed;
# take the wall clock off the first finished run and scale from that. This script does not
# submit it for you and does not fan out; it runs what you ask for, in order,
# and skips anything already finished. Start with the smoke.
#
# WHAT IS HELD FIXED, and how:
#   * one HDF5 per fold, shared by every variant -- the data cannot differ
#   * SEED is passed to finetune.py, which seeds the sampler, so a given
#     (fold, seed) sees the same batch order in every variant
#   * every legacy module is constructed and initialised before any channel
#     module exists, so the same seed gives every variant the same backbone
#   * every hyper-parameter other than the channel flags comes from
#     EEG/finetune_sleep.sh's defaults, untouched here

# Sweep hyper-parameters.
#
# Set here rather than left to the caller's shell. An ablation is only valid if
# every variant got the same ones, and "I remembered EPOCHS=10 on three of the
# four commands" leaves no trace in any output -- the runs simply differ, and
# the paired delta attributes the difference to the channel flags. One place,
# applied to every run, and recorded in each run's provenance.
#
# Every one is still overridable from the environment; do it once, for the
# whole sweep, not per variant.
#
# WARMUP_EPOCHS scales with EPOCHS. At 20 epochs a 3-epoch warmup is 15% of the
# schedule; leaving 3 in place at 10 epochs makes it 30%, and the cosine would
# spend most of the run still climbing. One epoch is 1031 steps at the default
# batch, which is ample in absolute terms.
