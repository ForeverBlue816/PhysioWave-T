Sleep-EDF Expanded (Sleep Cassette) -> labelled HDF5 for 5-class sleep staging.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The preprocessing deliberately reproduces EEGPT's `datasets/downstream/
prepare_sleep.py` step for step, because the point of running this dataset is
to sit next to their published number rather than beside it:

    * source        braindecode SleepPhysionet, which fetches Sleep-EDFx SC
                    from PhysioNet through MNE the first time it is asked
    * channels      the two EEG derivations, Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz, at 100 Hz
    * cropping      crop_wake_mins=30, so only 30 minutes of wake either side
                    of the sleep period is kept -- without this the class
                    balance is dominated by hours of pre-bed wake
    * scaling       volts to microvolts, then a 30 Hz lowpass
    * windows       30 s, non-overlapping, aligned to the hypnogram events,
                    i.e. 3000 samples
    * labels        W / N1 / N2 / N3 / REM, with the AASM merge of stages 3
                    and 4 into N3
    * normalising   per-channel z-score over the whole recording (see below)

What is NOT reproduced is their evaluation protocol. EEGPT trains 40 epochs
with no checkpoint callback and reports the validation fold, so the model is
selected on the set it is scored on. `--split holdout` keeps a test set that
nothing selects on; `--split eegpt-fold` reproduces their partition for a
like-for-like row. Report both and say which is which.

Two stages, because the download and the decoding are slow and the split is
not. `--stage cache` writes one .npz per subject; `--stage split` turns those
into HDF5. The default runs both.

Usage:
    pip install braindecode          # pulls in mne
    python EEG/sleep_edf_finetune.py --out-dir $PW_DATA_EEG/sleep_edf

Output, matching what finetune.py reads:
    data          (N, 2, 3000) float32
    label         (N,)         int64      0=W 1=N1 2=N2 3=N3 4=REM
    channel_names (2,)         bytes
    subject       (N,)         int64      provenance; unused by the trainer

# Pz-Oz share nothing: Cz is the negative end of the first and Oz of the second.
# Three things follow, and all three have been got wrong before:
#
#   * The recordings arrive already re-referenced. Calling set_eeg_reference()
#     on them would re-reference a derivation and produce a signal that is not
#     any montage.
#   * DERIVATION_MATRIX states what the channels *mean*. It is never multiplied
#     into the data -- the subtraction it describes already happened in the
#     recording hardware.
#   * The endpoints are declared here rather than parsed out of the name.
#     `split("-")` happens to work for "Fpz-Cz" and does not for "T3", "A1-A2"

    the raw is preloaded changes where `raw.crop` lands (2508001 samples
    against 2523000 for the same recording), and `create_windows_from_events`
    with drop_last_window=False adds one overlapping window per trial, so a
    hand-rolled version came out 15 windows different on subject 0 alone.
    Fifteen windows is small and comparability is the whole reason this file
    exists, so the dependency stays.
